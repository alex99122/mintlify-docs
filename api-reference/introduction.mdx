---

## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```
https://mannco.store
```

## Authentication

The API uses **JWT-based authentication** via API keys. You must include the JWT token in your requests.

### API Key Login Flow

1. Obtain an API key from your Mannco.store account settings
2. Call `POST /user/login` with your API key to receive a JWT token
3. Include the JWT token in subsequent requests (typically via cookies or Authorization header)

<Note>
  JWT tokens expire after 31 days. You'll need to re-authenticate after expiration.
</Note>

### CSRF protection

All `POST` requests may require CSRF validation depending on the endpoint configuration.

<Note>
  POST requests accept both `application/json` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content types. JSON payloads are automatically decoded.
</Note>

## Permission levels

Endpoints require specific permission levels:

| Permission | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Public** | No authentication required |
| **API** | Valid JWT token required (obtained via API key login) |
| **Connected** | User must be authenticated |
| **2FA** | User must have validated 2FA for the current session |
| **Admin** | User must have admin privileges |

Many endpoints have an admin variant that accepts a `{userid}` path parameter to operate on behalf of another user.

## Response format

All API responses return JSON with a **standardized structure**:

### Success responses

```json
{
  "err": false,
  "success": true,
  "content": {
    /* Response data here */
  }
}
```

### Error responses

```json
{
  "err": true,
  "success": false,
  "content": "Error message description"
}
```

### Response fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `err` | boolean | `false` for success, `true` for errors |
| `success` | boolean | `true` for success, `false` for errors |
| `content` | object/string | Response data (object) for success, error message (string) for errors |

## Error codes

| HTTP Code | Response Type | Description |

| `200` | Success | Request completed successfully |
| `300` | Error | General error (business logic error) |
| `403` | Forbidden/Unauthorized | Insufficient permissions, invalid CSRF, or invalid API key |
