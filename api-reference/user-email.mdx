## Email Change Flow

1. User calls `POST /user/email/change/request` with new email (requires 2FA)
2. System sends verification email to the new email address
3. User receives email with verification code
4. User calls `POST /user/email/change/validate` with the code and request ID
5. Email is changed, old sessions are terminated

<Note>
  The verification link/code expires after 24 hours. You can request a new email change if the link expires.
</Note>
